From 2016-2019 I laucnhed and operated Botany Coffee in Minneapolis, MN. My work in coffee and development have both involved the rewarding process of listening, understanding, learning, and creative problem solving. I find a lot of joy in working collaboratively to build projects that excite others.</Card>
